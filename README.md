# form-auto-save

This is a demo of a simple contact form that saves its state in local storage as you fill it out. The email
field is used as a unique identifier for each contact. You can confirm the email by entering it twice. Once
confirmed, the form state will be saved automatically as you make changes. You can select a saved contact from the dropdown to load its state back into the form.

## limitations

- can only support one form on the page.
- may not work with arrays.
